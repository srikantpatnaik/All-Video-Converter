This is a simple script which converts video formats.

Run the script once to create respective dirs.

Put your video files in 'original_videos' folder.

Run the script again, it will now create '.avi' files of all
the respective videos in 'original_videos' folder.

It will move the files into a '.tmp' folder before conversion.

By default the hidden folder '.tmp' is deleted.

You can comment the last line to prevent deletion.

the 'output_file' as mentioned in the script at line 26.
